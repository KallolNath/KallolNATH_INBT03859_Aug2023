**INeuBytes Data Science Internship - August-September 2023**

Welcome to my Data Science Internship repository with IneuBytes, where I've documented my journey in the field of data science during the August-September 2023 internship. This repository showcases my work on three exciting datasets, each involving data cleaning, data visualization, and the development of machine learning models.

**Datasets and Projects**

1. Heart Disease Prediction
Dataset: Heart Disease Dataset

In this project, I worked on predicting whether a patient is suffering from heart disease using various machine learning models. I conducted data cleaning, explored the data through visualization, and implemented predictive models to assist in heart disease diagnosis.

2. Air Pollution Analysis
Dataset: Air Pollution Dataset (Pm2.5)

In the Air Pollution Analysis project, I focused on studying the levels of Pm2.5 in the air. Through data preprocessing and visualization, I gained insights into air quality trends and pollution levels, contributing to environmental awareness.

3. Major Predictive Analysis and Customer Segmentation
Dataset: Customer Segmentation Dataset

This project involved predictive analysis and customer segmentation. I cleaned and prepared the data, visualized customer behavior, and developed segmentation models to help understand and target different customer groups effectively.
